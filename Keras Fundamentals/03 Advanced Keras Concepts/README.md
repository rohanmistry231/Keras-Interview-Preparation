# üöÄ Advanced Keras Concepts (`keras`)

## üìñ Introduction
Keras, built on TensorFlow, is a versatile API for scaling, extending, and deploying complex neural networks in AI and machine learning (ML). This section explores **Advanced Keras Concepts**, covering **Distributed Training**, **Advanced Architectures**, **Custom Extensions**, and **Deployment**. Building on core and intermediate Keras skills (e.g., CNNs, custom layers), it equips learners to handle large-scale ML workflows, advanced models, and production deployment, complementing Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib skills.

## üéØ Learning Objectives
- Scale Keras models with distributed training across multiple GPUs.
- Implement advanced architectures like Transformers and generative models.
- Extend Keras with custom metrics, callbacks, and hyperparameter optimization.
- Deploy Keras models for production and edge devices.

## üîë Key Concepts
- **Distributed Training**:
  - Data Parallelism (`tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy`).
  - Multi-GPU Training.
  - Distributed Datasets for efficient data loading.
- **Advanced Architectures**:
  - Transformers (BERT, Vision Transformers) for complex tasks.
  - Generative Models (VAEs, GANs) for data generation.
  - Autoencoders and Self-Supervised Learning for representation learning.
- **Custom Extensions**:
  - Custom Metrics and Callbacks for specialized monitoring.
  - Keras Tuner for hyperparameter optimization.
  - Integrating TensorFlow Addons for additional functionality.
- **Deployment**:
  - Model Export (SavedModel, ONNX) for interoperability.
  - Serving (TensorFlow Serving, FastAPI) for production.
  - Edge Deployment (TensorFlow Lite) for mobile/embedded devices.

## üìù Example Walkthroughs
The following Python files demonstrate each subsection:

1. **`distributed_training.py`**:
   - Trains a CNN on CIFAR-10 using `MirroredStrategy` for data parallelism.
   - Implements multi-GPU training with the same strategy.
   - Uses distributed datasets with `tf.data` for efficient data loading.
   - Visualizes training performance (loss and accuracy).

   Example code:
   ```python
   strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()
   with strategy.scope():
       model = keras.Sequential([keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu')])
   ```

2. **`advanced_architectures.py`**:
   - Builds a Vision Transformer for CIFAR-10 classification.
   - Trains a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) on MNIST for image generation.
   - Implements a GAN for MNIST digit generation.
   - Visualizes VAE-generated images and training loss.

   Example code:
   ```python
   x = keras.layers.MultiHeadAttention(num_heads=4, key_dim=64)(x, x)
   vae = keras.Model(encoder_inputs, decoder(encoder(encoder_inputs)[2]))
   ```

3. **`custom_extensions.py`**:
   - Defines a custom F1 score metric for CIFAR-10 classification.
   - Implements a custom callback to log epoch times.
   - Uses Keras Tuner for hyperparameter optimization (if available).
   - Visualizes custom F1 score performance.

   Example code:
   ```python
   class F1Score(keras.metrics.Metric):
       def result(self):
           p = self.precision.result()
           r = self.recall.result()
           return 2 * ((p * r) / (p + r + keras.backend.epsilon()))
   ```

4. **`deployment.py`**:
   - Exports a CIFAR-10 model as SavedModel and ONNX (if available).
   - Provides instructions for TensorFlow Serving setup.
   - Converts the model to TensorFlow Lite for edge deployment (if available).
   - Visualizes predictions from the SavedModel.

   Example code:
   ```python
   model.save('saved_model')
   converter = tflite.TFLiteConverter.from_keras_model(model)
   ```
