# üèóÔ∏è Core Keras Foundations (`keras`)

## üìñ Introduction
Keras, built on TensorFlow, is a high-level API for designing, training, and evaluating neural networks in AI and machine learning (ML). This section introduces the **Core Keras Foundations**, covering **Keras Basics**, **Automatic Differentiation**, **Neural Networks**, **Datasets and Data Loading**, and **Training Pipeline**. With practical examples and interview insights, it equips beginners to build and train neural networks, complementing Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib skills.

## üìù Example Walkthroughs
The following Python files demonstrate each subsection:

1. **`keras_basics.py`**:
   - Builds models with `Sequential`, `Functional API`, and `Model Subclassing`.
   - Uses layers (Dense, Conv1D, BatchNormalization) and activations (ReLU, Softmax).
   - Compiles models with different losses (MSE, Crossentropy) and optimizers (Adam, SGD).
   - Trains a model on synthetic data and visualizes performance.

   Example code:
   ```python
   model = keras.Sequential([keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')])
   model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy')
   ```

2. **`automatic_differentiation.py`**:
   - Computes gradients with `tf.GradientTape` for a simple function.
   - Trains a linear model with custom gradients.
   - Uses an optimizer (`Adam`) with `GradientTape`.
   - Trains a neural network with custom gradients and plots loss.

   Example code:
   ```python
   with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
       y_pred = w * X + b
       loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_pred - y))
   ```

3. **`neural_networks.py`**:
   - Builds a feedforward neural network (FNN) for MNIST classification.
   - Compiles with `model.compile` and trains with `model.fit`.
   - Uses callbacks (`EarlyStopping`, `ModelCheckpoint`).
   - Visualizes training loss and accuracy.

   Example code:
   ```python
   model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=5, callbacks=[keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping()])
   ```

4. **`datasets_data_loading.py`**:
   - Loads MNIST with `keras.datasets`.
   - Explores TensorFlow Datasets (`tfds.load`, commented if unavailable).
   - Creates a `tf.data.Dataset` pipeline with shuffle and batch.
   - Applies preprocessing and trains a model with the pipeline.

   Example code:
   ```python
   dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((X, y)).shuffle(10000).batch(128)
   ```

5. **`training_pipeline.py`**:
   - Sets up a training loop for MNIST with `model.fit` and `model.evaluate`.
   - Saves and loads models with `model.save` and `model.load`.
   - Trains on GPU with `tf.device`.
   - Monitors training with TensorBoard and visualizes performance.

   Example code:
   ```python
   model.fit(X_train, y_train, callbacks=[keras.callbacks.TensorBoard()])
   model.save('model.h5')
   ```
