# üß© Intermediate Keras Concepts (`keras`)

## üìñ Introduction
Keras, built on TensorFlow, is a powerful API for designing and optimizing complex neural networks in AI and machine learning (ML). This section explores **Intermediate Keras Concepts**, covering **Model Architectures**, **Customization**, and **Optimization**. Building on core Keras foundations (e.g., Sequential models, `tf.GradientTape`), it equips learners to develop advanced models, customize components, and optimize performance, complementing Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib skills.

## üéØ Learning Objectives
- Build and train advanced neural network architectures (CNNs, RNNs, transfer learning).
- Customize Keras models with custom layers, loss functions, and Functional API.
- Optimize models through hyperparameter tuning, regularization, and mixed precision training.

## üîë Key Concepts
- **Model Architectures**:
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image data.
  - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs) for sequential data.
  - Transfer Learning with pretrained models (`keras.applications`).
- **Customization**:
  - Custom Layers (`keras.layers.Layer`) for unique functionality.
  - Custom Loss Functions for specific objectives.
  - Functional API for complex model architectures.
  - Debugging Model Performance with validation metrics.
- **Optimization**:
  - Hyperparameter Tuning (learning rate, batch size).
  - Regularization (Dropout, L2) to prevent overfitting.
  - Mixed Precision Training (`keras.mixed_precision`) for efficiency.

## üìù Example Walkthroughs
The following Python files demonstrate each subsection:

1. **`model_architectures.py`**:
   - Builds a CNN for CIFAR-10 classification with Conv2D and MaxPooling2D.
   - Trains an LSTM on synthetic sequence data for binary classification.
   - Applies transfer learning with VGG16 on CIFAR-10.
   - Visualizes CNN training performance and confusion matrix.

   Example code:
   ```python
   model = keras.Sequential([keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu')])
   base_model = keras.applications.VGG16(weights='imagenet', include_top=False)
   ```

2. **`customization.py`**:
   - Defines a custom Dense layer by subclassing `keras.layers.Layer`.
   - Implements a custom loss function with regularization.
   - Builds a complex model with Functional API (concatenation).
   - Debugs model performance with validation loss curves.

   Example code:
   ```python
   class CustomDense(keras.layers.Layer):
       def call(self, inputs):
           return tf.matmul(inputs, self.w) + self.b
   ```

3. **`optimization.py`**:
   - Tunes learning rate and batch size for an MNIST model.
   - Applies Dropout and L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.
   - Trains with mixed precision for efficiency (optional).
   - Visualizes hyperparameter tuning and regularization effects.

   Example code:
   ```python
   model = keras.Sequential([keras.layers.Dropout(0.5)])
   mixed_precision.set_global_policy('mixed_float16')
   ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Practical Tasks
1. **Model Architectures**:
   - Build and train a CNN on CIFAR-10 with at least two convolutional layers.
   - Train an LSTM on a synthetic sequence dataset.
   - Fine-tune a pretrained VGG16 model on a small dataset.
2. **Customization**:
   - Create a custom layer with trainable weights.
   - Implement a custom loss function with a penalty term.
   - Build a multi-branch model using the Functional API.
3. **Optimization**:
   - Experiment with different learning rates and batch sizes.
   - Add Dropout and L2 regularization to a neural network.
   - Train a model with mixed precision and compare performance.
